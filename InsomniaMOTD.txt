As you may have noticed, v2.1.0
is now out! Boasting a ton of
changes and improvements to the
pack! Including (but not limited
to): 
- Reworked Nether generation.
- Improved difficulty scaling.
- Bug fixes.

On the official server, Nether 
will be opened as soon as it is
done pre-generating the terrain.

The End will still be closed for 
another 2 weeks.
